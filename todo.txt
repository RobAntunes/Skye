Awesome! Let’s dive into the next phase of implementation. We’ll start building out the component system, ensuring it boils down to web components, while maintaining the real-time state updates and function suspension from the reactive engine.

Here’s a breakdown of what we can do next:

1. Component Structure as Web Components

	•	Each component will be registered as a custom element.
	•	It will have its own lifecycle, updating in isolation without affecting its children or tree.
	•	Fine-grained reactivity will ensure only necessary parts update in real-time.

2. Template Parsing & Execution

	•	We’ll build a parser for the template that seamlessly integrates Dart-like features (loops, conditionals, and higher-order functions).
	•	The syntax will closely resemble JavaScript, eliminating extraneous curly braces.
	•	Each component’s template will directly execute JavaScript expressions, with reactive bindings wired up.

3. Real-Time Updates & Suspended Functions

	•	We’ll integrate the real-time updates for state changes directly into the component lifecycle.
	•	Suspended functions will be handled by the reactive engine, ensuring seamless state reactivity and rendering.

4. Fine-Grained Reactivity

	•	The reactive system will be optimized to handle property-level changes.
	•	Computed properties will be implemented, ensuring minimal updates when dependencies change.

5. Begin Implementation

	•	Start with the basic component system, register a web component, and ensure it can rerender in isolation.
	•	Then integrate the reactive engine into each component.
